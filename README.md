Full Stack Developer | JavaScript | React | Node.js

## Hello! 👋
I'm Yorvis, a passionate full stack developer with experience in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I specialize in building scalable and robust web applications using modern technologies and best development practices. 

## What I do 💼

- Development of complete web applications, from 🎨 design and 🏗️ architecture to 👨‍💻 implementation and 🚀 deployment.
- Building interactive and responsive user interfaces using React and other UI libraries. 🌐
- Designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express. 🚀
- Integrating relational databases using PostgreSQL to efficiently store and retrieve data. 🗃️
- Utilizing Redux for state management in large-scale applications. 🔄

### Bootcamp Experience ⚡️
During my time at Henry's Bootcamp, I had the opportunity to learn and work with a variety of exciting technologies. Some of the skills I acquired during my time at the bootcamp include:

- JavaScript: I mastered the fundamentals of JavaScript, allowing me to create dynamic and functional web applications.
- React: I learned how to develop interactive and responsive user interfaces using React, leveraging reusable components and the state-based approach.
- Node.js: I gained knowledge in the JavaScript runtime environment on the server side, enabling me to build scalable and high-performance web applications.
- Express: I learned how to use Express.js as a Node.js application framework to efficiently create RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL and Sequelize: I learned how to work with relational databases using PostgreSQL as the database management system, and Sequelize as an intuitive ORM for interacting with the database.

Additionally, during the bootcamp, I also acquired skills in using version control tools like Git, which allowed me to collaborate effectively with other developers and keep track of code changes.

## What I look forward to in the future 🔭

I am constantly learning and staying updated on the latest trends in web development. In the future, I hope to continue growing as a developer and expand my knowledge in the following areas:

- Exploring and mastering new technologies and frameworks that enhance my workflow and the quality of my projects.
- Participating in challenging and collaborative projects that allow me to expand my skills and knowledge.
- Contributing to open-source projects to make a positive impact on the development community.
- Staying up to date on best development practices and software architecture.
